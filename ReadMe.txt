I did PHP in second year last (which was 2 years ago so it took me some time to get used to coding in PHP again)
I did not follow the same design philosophy in some of the pages. This was intentional to show a that there are more than one way to do certain things. Example, submitted data is taken from a page to another page via $_POST/$_GET while on other pages the data required to be taken over to a different page is taken over VIA sessions. The idea is the same through most of the application.
